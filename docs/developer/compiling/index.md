# Compiling

OpenSees uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to provide a
consistent cross-platform building experience. A basic walkthrough of
this process is developed in `build-basic`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, but users who are new to working with C/C++ projects may
first want to read `build-tooling`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

If issues arise while following the basic methodology, it may be
necessary to modify some advaced configuration options.

For guides on adding new OpenSees components to the CMake build system,
see `extend`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
