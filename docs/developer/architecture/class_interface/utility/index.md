# Algebraic Classes

Numerical classes are used to pass numerical information between objects
and to handle the numerical operations in the solution procedure. 


The container classes provided include `Matrix`, `Vector`, and `ID`. The abstractions
provided by the `Matrix` and `Vector` classes should be apparent. The `ID` class
provides the abstraction of an integer array.
`SysOfEqn` provides abstractions for performing linear algebraic operations.

- [Matrix](Matrix)
- [Vector](Vector)
- [ID](ID)

- [SysOfEqn](sys_of_eqn)
