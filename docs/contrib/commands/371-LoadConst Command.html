# LoadConst Command

<p>This command is used to set the loads constant in the domain and to
also set the time in the domain. When setting the loads constant, the
procedure will invoke setLoadConst() on all LoadPattern objects which
exist in the domain at the time the command is called.</p>

```tcl
loadConst &lt;-time $pseudoTime&gt;
```

<td><p>Time domain is to be set to (optional)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<p>Load Patterns added afer this command is invoked are not set to
constant.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>loadConst -time 0.0; # sets loads constant and resets time to be
0.0</p>
