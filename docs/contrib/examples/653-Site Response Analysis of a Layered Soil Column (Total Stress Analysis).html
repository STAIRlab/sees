<p>This article describes the OpenSees implementation of a site response
analysis a soil deposit located above an elastic half-space using total
stress analysis. A single soil column is modeled in two-dimensions and
is subject to an earthquake ground motion in a manner which accounts for
the finite rigidity of the underlying medium.</p>
<p>Provided with this article are three input files which execute this
analysis in different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="freeFieldSingle.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldSingle.tcl</a> has a single soil layer for
simplicity and is intended to outline the basic analysis approach.</li>
<li><a href="freeFieldIndepend.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldIndepend.tcl</a> and <a
href="freeFieldDepend.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldDepend.tcl</a> are
two approaches to a comparison study with the 1D wave propagation
analysis tools ProShake and ProShakeNL (http://www.proshake.com/). Each
approach breaks the soil up into a series of sublayers, however, one
uses the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a>
material with user-generated modulus reduction (G/Gmax) curves while the
other uses the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1550.htm">PressureDependMultiYield</a>
material with automatically-generated G/Gmax curves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also included is the velocity time history of the selected ground
motion, velocityHistory.out. This file is required for the analysis.</p>
<p>Several helpful files are included as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>GilroyNo1EW.out, the acceleration time history for the selected
ground motion, as downloaded from the <a
href="http://peer.berkeley.edu/nga/">Peer NGA strong motion
database</a>, with the header information removed.</li>
<li>processMotion.m, a Matlab script which reshapes the GilroyNo1EW.out
acceleration history into a column vector, then integrates this using
the trapezoidal method to obtain the velocity time history needed for
the site response analysis.</li>
<li>accelPlot.m and respSpectra.m, Matlab scripts which produce the
verification plots included in this article from the recorded
results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Download them all in a compressed file: <a
href="Media:siteResponseAnalysis.zip"
title="wikilink">siteResponseAnalysis.zip</a></p>
<p>To run this example, the user must download the one of the input
files and the velocity time history file, velocityHistory.out, and place
them in a single directory. Once this has been done, the user can then
run the analysis. The <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a>
scripts and the acceleration time history files are not essential to the
analysis, however, they are provided to demonstrate how an alternative
acceleration time history can be converted into the analysis and how
certain plots can be obtained from the recorded output.</p>
<p>A large set of similar examples has been developed at the University
of California at San Diego. They are available at <a
href="http://cyclic.ucsd.edu/opensees">http://cyclic.ucsd.edu/opensees</a>.
These examples utilize a wide variety of element and material
formulations, as well as different boundary and loading conditions than
those used in this example. The user is referred to these examples for
further information on how to set up a site response model in
OpenSees.</p>

<p>In this article, the site response analyses are performed for soil
deposits which are underlain by an elastic half-space, which simulates
the finite rigidity an underlying medium such as bedrock. It is assumed
that there is no groundwater, therefore, total stress analysis is used
in this example. The soil is modeled in two-dimensions with two
degrees-of-freedom using the plane strain formulation of the <a
href="Quad_Element" title="wikilink">quad element</a> element. The
provided input files consider only a single layer of soil, however, the
files <a href="freeFieldIndepend.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldIndepend.tcl</a> and <a
href="freeFieldDepend.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldDepend.tcl</a>,
consider a soil profile which has a parabolically-increasing shear wave
velocity profile with depth. This is accomplished using sublayers, thus,
the use of multiple soil layers in an OpenSees site response analysis is
demonstrated. A general schematic of the model is shown in Fig. 1. In
this example, the horizontal direction is the first degree-of-freedom
and the vertical is the second. The soil node, element, and layer
numbering schemes all begin at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The remainder of the main model description in
this article, when not otherwise specified, refers to the simpler of the
three provided input files, <a href="freeFieldSingle.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldSingle.tcl</a>, with the intention of
highlighting the main site response analysis details. The other input
files are essentially the same, with the main difference being the
complexity introduced by the inclusion of multiple layers. The more
complex files are explained later in this article during the discussion
of the comparison study.</p>
<p>To account for the finite rigidity of the underlying half-space, a
Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot is incorporated at the base of the soil
column using a <a href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">zeroLength
element</a> and the <a href="Viscous_Material" title="wikilink"> viscous
uniaxial material</a>. The Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot is assigned
a dashpot coefficient equal to the product of the mass density and shear
wave velocity of the underlying layer with the area of the base of the
soil column. In this example, the properties of a bedrock layer are used
for the half-space. The soil column is excited at the base by a
horizontal force time history which is proportional to the known
velocity time history of the ground motion. Further information on this
modeling approach can be found in Joyner and Chen (1975) and Lysmer
(1978) among others.</p>
<p>The horizontal force time history is applied as a <a
href="Path_TimeSeries" title="wikilink">Path TimeSeries</a> object using
the file, velocityHistory.out. The force history is obtained by
multiplying the known velocity time history by a constant factor set as
the product of the area of the base of the soil column (width x
thickness) with the mass density and shear wave velocity of the
underlying layer. The area of the soil column is included to ensure
proportional loading for any desired horizontal element size. The
provided Matlab script, processMotion.m, shows how the velocity time
history was obtained from the selected acceleration time history.</p>
<h3 id="soil_profile_geometry">Soil Profile Geometry</h3>
<p>For the simple soil profile considered in the file <a
href="freeFieldSingle.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldSingle.tcl</a>, the
soil profile geometry is controlled entirely by the thickness of the
soil deposit. In this example, this value is set at 40 meters.</p>
<p>In the multi-layered soil profiles in the other input files, the soil
profile geometry is controlled by a specified number of layers and the
thicknesses of each individual soil layer. In this case the overall
thickness of the soil profile is the sum of the layer thicknesses.</p>
<h3 id="mesh_geometry">Mesh Geometry</h3>
<p>The geometry of the mesh is based upon the concept of resolving the
propagation of the shear waves at or below a particular frequency by
ensuring that an adequate number of elements fit within the wavelength
of the chosen shear wave. This ensures that the mesh is refined enough
such that the desired aspects of the propagating waves are well captured
in the analysis.</p>
<p>This is accomplished in the model by specifying the highest frequency
which the user wishes to be well resolved and the number of elements
that the user desires to be in one wavelength of a shear wave
propagating at this frequency. The wavelength used to define the mesh
geometry is determined by dividing the minimum shear wave velocity of
the soil profile by the specified cutoff frequency. In the provided
examples there are either 8 or 10 elements per wavelength. The largest
value possible value for the specified frequency is the sampling
frequency of the ground motion. The provided examples use 100 Hz for the
cutoff frequency.</p>
<p>The horizontal size of the elements is set to be the minimum vertical
element size in the soil column. The number of nodes and the total
number of elements are computed automatically. The number of elements is
based on the computed element size and the thickness of the soil
deposit. For <em>n</em> total elements, there are <em>2n + 1</em> total
nodes.</p>
<h3 id="soil_nodes">Soil Nodes</h3>
<p>The soil nodes are created automatically from the input geometry and
meshing information. As shown in Fig. 1, the node numbering scheme is
left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Nodes with even numbers fall on the
y-axis, and the odd-numbered nodes are spaced horizontally by the
computed horizontal element size.</p>
<h3 id="dashpot_nodes">Dashpot Nodes</h3>
<p>A single <a href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">zeroLength
element</a> is used to define the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot,
therefore, only two nodes are required. These nodes are arbitrarily
assigned numbers 2000 and 2001. If the user has modified the meshing
information such that there are more than 2000 nodes in the soil column,
the dashpot node numbers will need to be changed.</p>
<h3 id="boundary_conditions_and_equal_degrees_of_freedom">Boundary
Conditions and Equal Degrees-of-Freedom</h3>
<p>The nodes at the base of the column are fixed against displacements
in the y-direction in accordance with the assumption that the soil
layers are underlain by bedrock. The remaining soil nodes are then tied
together using the <a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF
command</a> in order to achieve a simple shear deformation pattern. This
is done by declaring equalDOF for every pair of nodes which share the
same y-coordinate.</p>
<p>One of the dashpot nodes is fully fixed (node 2000), while the other
is fixed only against displacements in the y-direction (node 2001). To
incorporate the dashpot element into the total model, equalDOF is again
used, this time linking the horizontal degrees-of-freedom of the
partially fixed dashpot node and one of the nodes at the base of the
soil column.</p>
<h3 id="soil_material_properties_and_objects">Soil Material Properties
and Objects</h3>
<p>A series of material properties are required to define the
constitutive behavior of the soil and the underlying elastic half-space.
The main soil properties are the mass density, the shear wave velocity,
and Poisson's ratio. From these, the elastic, shear, and bulk moduli are
computed. Poisson's ratio is set as zero in these examples for the
purposes of emulating a one-dimensional analysis. With Poisson's ratio
at zero, no vertical accelerations are generated.</p>
<p>The remaining soil properties correspond to the particular
constitutive model selected in each analysis, either <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1550.htm">PressureDependMultiYield</a>
or <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a>.
For these examples, these properties are largely based on the
recommendations detailed on the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1550.htm">PressureDependMultiYield</a>
or <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a>
pages of the OpenSees command manual.</p>
<p>For the case of multiple layers, one material object is created for
each layer using the material properties defined in the input file. With
the exception of a few global properties, each layer is given a separate
set of properties.</p>
<p>During the creation of these examples is was noted that using too few
yield surfaces in these nested surface models, or using poorly spaced
user-generated surfaces, can cause high frequency shaking to develop in
the model. This appears to be due to the way in which these constitutive
models work. There is not one consistent tangent over the length of the
backbone curve, instead, a smooth backbone curve is approximated using a
series of linear segments. If there are too few, or poorly spaced, yield
surfaces, a dramatic change in stiffness can occur as the stress path
crosses a particular yield surface, resulting in a shock which is
manifested as the observed high frequency shaking. This behavior can be
alleviated by using a larger number of yield surfaces, resulting in a
smoother approximation to the backbone curve of the soil. Care should be
taken, however, depending upon the intentions of the analysis. As the
number of surfaces increases, the time needed to complete the analysis
also increases, and in the end, the inclusion of this high frequency
shaking does not significantly alter the results of the simulation. It
is recommended that the user keep these ideas in mind when selecting the
number of surfaces to use in a particular analysis.</p>
<h3 id="soil_elements">Soil Elements</h3>
<p>Four-node quad elements are used to model the soil using the plane
strain formulation of the <a href="Quad_Element" title="wikilink">quad
element</a>. The element connectivity uses a counterclockwise pattern
for the previously-described node numbering scheme (see Fig. 1). The
soil elements in each layer are assigned the material tag of the
material object corresponding to that layer. A unit thickness is used in
all examples. The self-weight of the soil is considered as a body force
acting on each element. The body force is set as the unit weight of the
soil in each layer, which is determined from the respective mass density
input value.</p>
<h3 id="dashpot_material_and_element">Dashpot Material and Element</h3>
<p>The <a href="Viscous_Material" title="wikilink"> viscous uniaxial
material</a> is used to define the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot.
This material model requires a single input, the dashpot coefficient,
<em>c</em>. Following the method of Joyner and Chen (1975), the dashpot
coefficient is defined as the product of the mass density and shear wave
velocity of the underlying medium, which, in this example, is assumed to
have the properties of bedrock. The dashpot coefficient must also
include the area of the base of the soil column to maintain proportional
results for any horizontal element size. Since the elements are created
with unit thickness, this area is simply the computed horizontal element
size.</p>
<p>A <a href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">zeroLength
element</a> is used for the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot. This
element connects the two previously-defined dashpot nodes and is
assigned the material tag of the Viscous uniaxial material object in the
first degree-of-freedom (horizontal direction).</p>
<h3 id="recorders">Recorders</h3>
<p>The <a href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">recorders</a> defined
for this example document the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nodal displacements, velocities, and accelerations in both
degrees-of-freedom</li>
<li>the stress and strain response at each Gauss point in each
element</li>
</ul>
<p>The recorded nodal values are the true values for each parameter, not
relative values as with the uniformExcitation command.</p>
<p>Two sets of recorders are included to capture the response of the
soil during the gravity analysis (which is sometimes useful to ensure
proper model generation) and the response of the soil during the
application of the ground motion. These files are differentiated by a
naming scheme in which the records corresponding to the gravity analysis
are named 'Gacceleration', 'Gstress', etc ...</p>
<h3 id="gravity_loading_and_analysis">Gravity Loading and Analysis</h3>
<p>The gravity analysis in this example is conducted as a <a
href="analysis_Command" title="wikilink">transient analysis</a> with
very large time steps, thus simulating a static analysis while avoiding
the conflicts which may occur when mixing static and transient analyses.
The self-weight of the soil elements provides the loads, therefore, no
loading object is required. Gravity is applied for ten steps with
entirely elastic constitutive behavior. This allows the material objects
to update various parameters to account for confining pressure. Once
these steps have converged, the material objects are updated using the
<a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1559.htm">updateMaterialStage
command</a> to consider elastoplastic behavior, and the gravity analysis
is repeated for 40 steps.</p>
<h3 id="horizontal_loading_and_analysis">Horizontal Loading and
Analysis</h3>
<p>Using the method of Joyner and Chen (1975), dynamic excitation is
applied as a force time history to the base of the soil column, at the
node which shares equal degrees-of-freedom with the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer
(1969) dashpot. This force history is obtained by multiplying the
velocity time history of the recorded ground motion by the mass density
and shear wave velocity of the underlying bedrock layer and the area of
the base of the soil column (the horizontal element size in these
examples). This technique considers the finite rigidity of the
underlying layer by allowing energy to be radiated back into the
underlying material.</p>
<p>The force history is applied to the model as a <a
href="Path_TimeSeries" title="wikilink">Path TimeSeries</a> object using
a <a href="Plain_Pattern" title="wikilink">Plain load pattern</a>
object. The actual force applied to the node in each time step is the
product of the load factor indicated in the pattern object (1.0 in this
example), the additional load factor included in the timeSeries object,
and the value found in the file, velocityHistory.out, at that time step.
The load factor included in the timeSeries object is used to create a
force history from the velocity history found in the namesake file.</p>
<p>The transient analysis is conducted with the <a href="Newmark_Method"
title="wikilink"> Newmark integrator</a> using the gamma and beta
coefficients defined near the top of the input file. These values are
set at 0.5 and 0.25, respectively to ensure there is no numerical
damping in the analysis.</p>
<p>Since these models consider elastoplastic soil behavior, there is
inherent hysteretic damping which occurs, however, a small amount of
Rayleigh damping is used so there is still some damping at low strain
values. The level of Rayleigh damping is controlled by the damping ratio
and the circular frequencies of two modes of vibration. This type of
approach is discussed in most dynamic analysis texts, such as Chopra
(2007).</p>
<p>The time step used in the analysis is selected to meet stability
considerations using the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) condition
(discussed well by LeVeque, 2007). Meeting the requirements of this
condition ensures that the time step is small enough for stability given
the maximum shear wave velocity and the minimum vertical element size in
the model. The example files are set up such that the analysis time step
and the corresponding number of steps are automatically generated to
satisfy this condition. If the required time step is larger than the
time step increment found in the recorded ground motion, the value
specified in the ground motion is used. If the user alters the shear
wave velocity profile such that the lowest layer does not have the
highest shear wave velocity, then the value of $vsMax used in this
routine will need to be updated.</p>

<p>To validate the site response analysis framework used in these
examples, a comparison study was accomplished using the one-dimensional,
equivalent linear site response analysis program <a
href="http://www.proshake.com/">ProShake</a> and the one-dimensional,
nonlinear site response analysis program ProShakeNL. The input files <a
href="freeFieldIndepend.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldIndepend.tcl</a>
and <a href="freeFieldDepend.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldDepend.tcl</a> were used for this purpose.</p>
<p>In the comparison study, a sand deposit having a
parabolically-increasing shear wave velocity profile with depth was
selected. This profile is implemented in OpenSees using 30 material
layers, each having a specified shear wave velocity, which is then used
to compute appropriate values for the shear and bulk moduli. It is
important to note that the pressure dependency exponent is set to zero
so the input values of shear and bulk modulus for each layer are not
updated based on the overburden stress in each element.</p>
<p>The layering scheme was set up to match that used in the 1D analyses,
with each layer having appropriate material parameters, and all analyses
used the same ground motion applied to the base of the soil deposit. The
1D analyses include an infinite elastic half-space below the soil
deposit, and these layers were assigned properties corresponding the
bedrock properties used in the OpenSees analyses.</p>
<p>The two example input files represent two separate approaches to this
comparison study. In the file, <a href="freeFieldIndepend.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldIndepend.tcl</a>, the soil is defined using
the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a>
nDMaterial, and the user-generated modulus reduction (G/Gmax) option is
used, with the selected G/Gmax curves matching those used in the Shake
analyses. Using this approach, the strength of each soil layer is
defined entirely by the input G/Gmax data and the shear modulus value
assigned to that layer. Parameters such as friction angle and cohesion
are not used for this purpose. Though the material is called 'pressure
independent', it is important to note that pressure dependency was
manually introduced into the model by specifying the shear wave velocity
of each layer. If it is also assumed that the confining pressure will
not dramatically change during the excitation, then this approach
becomes even more acceptable, especially in a free-field analysis where
2D elements are used to mimic a 1D analysis.</p>
<p>Figs. 4 and 5 show the surface acceleration histories and the
response spectra at the surface, respectively, obtained from the
analysis using the file, <a href="freeFieldIndepend.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldIndepend.tcl</a>, alongside the results
obtained from ProShake and ProShakeNL. As shown, the OpenSees analysis
correlates well with the results obtained using the nonlinear 1D
analysis (ProShakeNL). It is interesting to note the differences between
the equivalent-linear approach of ProShake and the nonlinear approaches
used by OpenSees and ProShakeNL. As shown in Fig. 4, during the low
amplitude shaking near the beginning of the motion, the ProShake results
are significantly different from the others. In the nonlinear analyses,
during this initial low amplitude shaking the response is elastic.
Plastic behavior does not occur until the stronger shaking which occurs
later in the motion. In the equivalent-linear approach, this type of
response cannot be captured for a strong motion such as that used in
this example. If the largest shaking is enough to produce plastic
response, then the soil acts as if it is plastic during the entire
motion. One way to use an equivalent-linear analysis tool to check
nonlinear results is to use motions in which the amplitudes are scaled
down.</p>
<p>The second comparison example, found in the file, <a
href="freeFieldDepend.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldDepend.tcl</a>,
represents a more typical approach to a site response analysis of a sand
profile in OpenSees. The <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1550.htm">PressureDependMultiYield</a>
nDMaterial is used, with soil properties corresponding to those used in
the two Shake analyses, and automatically-generated yield surfaces
(G/Gmax) curves. In this case, the constitutive model used the specified
friction angle to define the strength of each layer, however, in order
to maintain a shear wave velocity profile which corresponds to the other
analyses, the pressure dependency exponent is set to zero and the shear
wave values are input manually for each layer. If this was not a desired
aspect of the analysis, a single material could be used along with a
non-zero pressure dependency exponent to produce a pressure-dependent
stiffness profile.</p>
<p>Figs. 6 and 7 show the surface acceleration histories and the
response spectra at the surface, respectively, obtained from the
analysis using the file, <a href="freeFieldDepend.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldDepend.tcl</a>, alongside the results obtained
from ProShake and ProShakeNL. As shown, the OpenSees analysis correlates
well with the results obtained using ProShakeNL during lower amplitude
shaking, though it deviates during the stronger shaking portions of the
motion. The peak ground acceleration returned using this approach
correlates fairly well with the equivalent-linear results, though this
may be coincidental to the amount of Rayleigh damping used in the
analysis.</p>
<p>This comparison study has demonstrated that a site response analysis
conducted in OpenSees using the approaches detailed in these examples is
capable of producing results which correlate well with commonly used
site response analysis approaches. The approach that is selected should
depend upon the objectives of the particular analysis in which they will
be used. If the goal of the analysis is to emulate results obtained
using a 1D analysis tool, the approach used in <a
href="freeFieldIndepend.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldIndepend.tcl</a>
is recommended, however, it is noted that care should be taken when
attempting to use this approach in a two-dimensional analysis (i.e. more
than just a single soil column). For 2D analyses, it is often easier and
more realistic to define materials with pressure dependent strength,
such as sands, using and approach similar to that in <a
href="freeFieldDepend.tcl" title="wikilink">freeFieldDepend.tcl</a>.</p>
