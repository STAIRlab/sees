# Simulating a Centrifuge Test

<hr />
<p>This article describes the basic OpenSees features needed for the
simulation of vertically propagating shear waves in a scale model in a
centrifuge. GID has been used for pre- and post- processing. For
relatively simple configurations (even the one used in this paradigm) a
pre-processor might not be needed, but a post-processor is necessary to
visualize field output results. For every presented feature an example
command is excerpted from the example tcl file and explained in detail.
This tutorial does not explain though in every detail all the options
associated in the various commands used. For this, the reader is
directed to the OpenSees manual (the most recent is the on-line version
of it). The commands and features used in this analysis have been tested
with OpenSees versions 1.74, 1.75 and 2.0 but should also work for newer
versions too. In case an example does not work, I would be obliged to
hear about possible problems at avytin [at] mit . edu.</p>
<p>This manual explains how one can create a .tcl file that could be
read and executed by the OpenSees interpreter. Notice should be taken
that OpenSees is dimensionless, so the user must make sure that he uses
a consistent system of units (e.g. SI).</p>
<p>Once an example.tcl file has been created, the user can then simply
run OpenSees.exe, and in turn, write in the command line of the
interpreter "source example.tcl" to run his analysis.</p>
<h2 id="simulated_geometry">Simulated Geometry</h2>
<p>The centrifuge model geometry that we need to simulate is shown
below. The model consists of two blocks of dense sand. On top of this
lies a layer of loose liquefiable sand and on the top there are two
facing slopes of Yolo Loam. The right hand side is treated with
earthquake drains (PV-Drains) to accelerate the dissipation of excess
pore pressure. An acceleration pattern is applied on the bottom of the
model.</p>

<h2 id="elements_used">Elements Used</h2>
<p>The elements used in this simulation are described in this
section.</p>
<p>The Yolo Loam layer is simulated using total stress analysis with
4-noded quad elements. This element can be used to perform drained
analysis, total stress analysis, and undrained analysis when coupled
with the FluidSolidPorousMaterial material wrapper. An example of this
command taken from the example's code is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; element
quad 1 2327 2351 2326 2302 1.0 "PlaneStrain" 1 $press 1.3 $gravX
$gravY''' &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>This command defines a planestrain quad element with id 1, that
connects the nodes 2327, 2351, 2326, and 2302. The element has an
out-of-plane width of 1 unit. The mechanical behavior is prescribed by
material 1. The hydrostatic pressure of the element is the value of
press. The total density of the material in the quad element is 1.3. The
gravitational components in both directions are defined by the values of
the parameters gravX and gravY.</p>
<p>The sand layer is simulated using 4-noded quadUP elements. These
elements have three degrees of freedom per node: two for displacements,
and one for pore pressure. It is important to keep in mind that the
velocity, and not the displacement, of the 3rd DOF is the pore pressure,
when requesting output or applying pore pressure conditions on the
model. These elements can be used to model coupled pore pressure
displacement analysis following the u-p formulation. Since they are
four-noded they are expected not to perform very well in situations
where they simulate incompressible behavior (e.g. undrained conditions).
For completely undrained conditions the previously mentioned quad
elements should be used together with the FluidSolidPorousMaterial
material wrapper. An example how to define a quadUP element is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; element
quadUP 417 4190 4191 4200 4199 1.0 3 $bulk 1. [expr 0.0003/9.81/1.]
[expr 0.0003/9.81/1.] $gravX $gravY $press &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>This command creates a 4-noded planestrain quadUP element with id 417
that connects the nodes 4190, 4191, 4200, 4199. The element has a
out-of-plane width of 1 unit. The mechanical behavior is prescribed by
material 3. The bulk modulus of the pore fluid is the value of the
variable bulk. The fluid mass density is 1. The hydraulic conductivity
is k=0.0003. The gravitational components are defined by the values of
the parameters gravX and gravy. The element also has a hydrostatic
compression equal to the value of the variable press.</p>
<p>The soil material on the Yolo loam layer, where the effective
stresses are small, should be able to disconnect from the laminar box.
In order for this behavior to be modeled correctly, a zeroLength element
should be defined. A zeroLength element connects two nodes that have the
same, or almost the same coordinates according to an internally
pre-specified threshold. The mechanical properties of this connection
are defined by a uniaxial material which is attached to the zeroLength
element. A sample definition of this type of element is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; element
zeroLength 3933 4205 4221 -mat 7 7 -dir 1 2 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>This command creates a zeroLength element with id 3933 that connects
the nodes 4205 and 4221. The mechanical behavior of this connection is
prescribed by the uniaxial material 7 in direction 1 and by the same
material in direction 2.</p>
<h2 id="materials_used">Materials Used</h2>
<p>In this model, there are two types of materials being used. The first
type are the continuum material models, referred to as nDMaterial, that
are used to simulate the mechanical behaviour of sand, and they are
attached to continuum elements. The second type are the uniaxial
material elements that are attached either to ZeroLength elements, or to
one-dimensional elements (e.g. beams or trusses). If they are attached
to ZeroLength elements then their properties are used to simulate the
force-displacement behaviour. If they are attached to one-dimensional
elements then they simulate the stress-strain behaviour of the material
in the element.</p>
<p>The Yolo Loam is modeled using a PressureIndependMultiYield material.
This material exhibits plasticity only on the deviatoric stress space.
It can be used to model the behavior of pressure independent materials,
such as clays under usual states of stress (or clay-type material, such
as Yolo Loam in this case). An example definition of the
PressureIndependMultiyield model is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
nDMaterial PressureIndependMultiYield 1 2 1.37 13000 65000 6. .1
&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>This command creates a PressureIndependMultiYield nDMaterial with tag
1, which is going to be used in a two-dimensional space. The material
has a density of 1.37, a reference shear modulus of 13 000, a reference
bulk modulus of 65 000, a cohesion of 6, and a peak shear strain
parameter of 0.1.</p>
<p>The Sand layer is modeled using a PressureDependMultiYield02
nDMaterial model. This material allows for stress level dependent
behavior, and shear induced volumetric strains, being able to model
cyclic mobility and liquefaction. An example definition of this material
is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
nDMaterial PressureDependMultiYield02 2 2 2.07 130000 260000 36.5 .1 80
0.5 26. 0.013 0.0 0.3 0.0 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>This command creates a PressureDependMultiYield02 nDMaterial Model
with tag 2, which is going to be used in a two-dimensional space. The
material has a total density of 2.07, a reference shear modulus of 130
000, a reference bulk modulus of 260 000, a friction angle of 36.5, a
peak shear strain of 0.1, a reference pressure of 80, a
pressuredependence coefficient of 0.5, a phase transformation angle of
26, a contraction1 parameter of 0.013, a contraction3 parameter of 0.0,
a dilation1 parameter of 0.3, and dilation3 parameter of 0.0.</p>
<p>The connection between the quad soil elements of the top soil layer
(Yolo Loam) with the box is modeled using a no tension material. In
order for the analysis to converge more easily we couple in parallel the
no-tension material with an elastic material of very small elastic
modulus. An example of defining an elastic uniaxial material is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
uniaxialMaterial Elastic 9 10 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>which defines a linear Elastic uniaxialMaterial with id 9, and
elastic modulus (E) of 10.</p>
<p>An example of defining an elastic no-tension material is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
uniaxialMaterial ENT 8 1000000000 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>which defines an ENT (Elastic-No-Tension) uniaxialMaterial with id 8,
and an elastic modulus (E) of 1 000 000 000.</p>
<p>In order to combine the above two materials in parallel a Parallel
uniaxialMaterial object should be defined:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
uniaxialMaterial Parallel 7 8 9 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>which defines a Parallel uniaxialMaterial with id 7, where
uniaxialMaterial 8 and uniaxialMaterial 9 behave as two springs in
parallel.</p>
<h2 id="treatment_of_boundary_conditions">Treatment of Boundary
Conditions</h2>
<h3 id="bottom_boundary_conditions">Bottom Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>The bottom of the model is fixed in such a way that no movement is
allowed on the vertical and horizontal direction. The pore pressure is
allowed to fluctuate freely, which means that there is no drainage on
the bottom. An example of a fixity command that fixes direction 1 (x), 2
(y), and leaves direction 3 (pore pressure) free is:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; fix 925
1 1 0 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<h3 id="side_boundary_conditions">Side Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>The displacements of the model on the sides at the level of the dense
sand and the loose sand layers are fixed with periodic boundary
conditions; each side has the same displacement with the other side. The
command below ties the first and the second degree of freedom (DOF) of
elements 58 and 4148.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
equalDOF 58 4148 1 2 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The nodes on the Yolo Loam level are connected at first with nodes
with the same coordinates (representing the laminar box) with ENT
zeroLength elements and, these nodes are connected with equalDOF objects
with nodes on the other side of the box (periodic boundaries).</p>
<h3 id="earthquake_drain_pore_pressure_conditions">Earthquake Drain Pore
Pressure Conditions</h3>
<p>The drainage system is modelled as perfect drains; fixed pore
pressure conditions are applied to them throughout the analysis. A pore
pressure condition can be specified using the Timeseries command (to
specify the behaviour of the condition vs. Time) and the MultipleSupport
groundmotion command to specify the node and DOF to which the Timeseries
applies at.</p>
<p>The code below is used to specify the pore pressure at a point on the
top of the EQ-drain:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set
Timeseries64 "Constant -factor 0.4495"</p>
<p>pattern MultipleSupport 3 {</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>groundMotion 64 Plain -vel $Timeseries64</p>
<p>imposedMotion 64 3 64</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>} &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The command creates a MultipleSupport pattern object with id 3, an
object that allows users to define a fixed acceleration, velocity, or
displacement of a specific DOF on a specific node. It then applies the
conditions for every node. For every node we specify a imposedMotion
object that attaches a specified groundMotion to the node. In this case,
we create a groundMotion object with id 64 that is Plain, of type
velocity, and has as arguments the value of the parameter Timeseries64
(Constant timeseries of value 0.4495). By means, of this set of commands
we specify that the pore pressure in node 64 has a value of 0.4495. If
applying this boundary condition does not work, one should specify
acceleration, velocity, and displacement boundary conditions all at the
same time, at the same node.</p>
<h3 id="top_pore_pressure_conditions">Top Pore Pressure Conditions</h3>
<p>When one defines the ground water level to be above the ground
surface (and applies the relevant pore pressure conditions on top), one
needs also to apply the hydrostatic pressure of the water normal to the
ground surface in order for the effective stresses to be computed
correctly.</p>
<p>The code below shows the application of pore pressure 5.6658 at node
1761.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set
Timeseries1761 "Constant -factor 5.6658"</p>
<p>pattern MultipleSupport 3 {</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>groundMotion 31761 Plain -vel $Timeseries1761</p>
<p>imposedMotion 1761 3 31761</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>} &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>In order to match the effective stresses on the top of the layer in
the middle of the central channel, where the ground water level is above
the soil surface, one should also specify the loads applied due to the
water weight to the soil surface with the following command:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set
Timeseries "Constant -factor -1.8"</p>
<p>pattern Plain 4 $Timeseries {</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>load 1561 0. .1 0.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>} &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The above command specifies a vertical load of -0.18 on the node
1561. By applying these loads we make sure that the effective stresses
at the ground surface are exactly zero.</p>
<p>Also, the shear rings of the laminar box have a specific mass. We
apply concentrated mass at the x direction on the side nodes of the
model. The following command specifies a nodal mass of the value of
0.01015 at the node 58:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; mass 58
0.01015 0 0 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>In this model there are two types of domains, the two-DOF domain
where the quad elements and their respective nodes have been created,
and the three-DOF domain where the quadup elements and their respective
nodes have been created. In order for the two domains to be connected
the nodes on the common boundaries of the two domains are connected with
equalDOF objects, as shown below.</p>

<h2 id="solution_procedure">Solution Procedure</h2>
<p>The typical solution procedure used is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use elastic material for the entire model, turn on the gravity and
solve the static case. The way this is performed is by solving a coupled
transient analysis with a very large time-step, and very large gamma
(1.5). The gamma parameter of the Newmark integrator controls the
numerical damping (not the Rayleigh damping). If gamma=0.5 then there is
no numerical damping. A value of gamma=1.6 makes sure that the initial
dynamic transient will dissipate very quickly. The very large time-step
(dt=5.e5) is used to make sure that the analysis is drained, and that
any initial excess pore pressures have dissipated. The large time-step
also helps the dissipation of the initial transient. In the elastic
analysis one can choose the Poisson's ratio in such a way that the
initial K0 value is predicted correctly.</li>
<li>After the elastic step, when all the initial transients and excess
pore pressures have dissipated, the material is switched to an
elasto-plastic state, and a similar analysis with large gamma and large
time-step is performed.</li>
<li>After the elasto-plastic gravity step the analysis object is
destroyed, and the time is reset to zero. Then the dynamic analysis is
executed.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a typical procedure used for the UCSD soil models. For other
models it might not be possible to run the elastic step, so one should
start directly with the second step of the analysis. In that case, the
user should pay extra attention to (1) make the analysis converge
correctly to the initial state, and (2) correctly track and assign the
model state parameters.</p>
<h3 id="elastic_gravity_step">Elastic Gravity Step</h3>
<p>The models created by UCSD (PressureDependMultiYield,
PressureInDependMultiYield, PressureDependMultiYield02) have been
implemented with an internal switch parameter that allows them to behave
either as linear elastic, elasto-plastic, or elastic pressure-dependent.
In order to switch this type of material to an elastic state for the
elastic part of the gravity loading the following command is issued:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
updateMaterialStage -material 1 -stage 0 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The command above specifies that material 1 should behave according
to stage flag 0, which is a linear elastic state.</p>
<p>Next, the analysis objects need to be defined:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set
gamma 1.6</p>
<ol>
<li>create the SOE, ConstraintHandler, Integrator, Algorithm and
Numberer</li>
</ol>
<p>integrator Newmark $gamma [expr pow($gamma+0.5, 2)/4] 0.00 0.0 0.00
0.0</p>
<p>test EnergyIncr 1.0e-8 400 1;</p>
<p>constraints Transformation</p>
<p>algorithm Newton</p>
<p>numberer RCM</p>
<p>system ProfileSPD</p>
<p>analysis Transient &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The above command creates a Newmark integrator with gamma=1.6. Beta
b=(gamma+0.5)2/4 is chosen because this value provides unconditional
stability of the integration algorithm. The Newmark integrator has been
shown to produce spurious oscillations in the results, so it is
advisable to use the HHT integrator, when possible. On the other hand,
the choice of an integrator is also judged on a case to case basis based
on its convergence and speed.</p>
<p>The test to judge when convergence has been achieved is based on
increments of energy. This is a good criterion in an elasto-plastic
problem where increments of displacement can be really large during
yielding.</p>
<p>The constraint handler is set as the transformation handler, after
recommendations from the creators of the quadUP elements when one is
applying pore pressure boundary conditions.</p>
<p>The algorithm selected is a Newton algorithm. It is a robust and
simple algorithm with asymptotically quadratic rate of convergence. The
Newton-Raphson algorithms are computationally expensive and are known to
suffer from residual flip flop due to sudden changes in the tangent
stiffness matrix. Linear convergence can be achieved with ModifiedNewton
algorithms. In principle, the fastest implemented algorithm should be
the KrylovNewton, so it should be preferred, but there are situations
that it might not converge to a solution.</p>
<p>The system used is a ProfileSPD. The Jacobian matrix of frictional
materials is not symmetric, but in many situations ignoring the
non-symmetric elements can help improve performance without significant
differences in the results. A good alternative would be an unsymmetric
system like UmfPack.</p>
<p>Finally the analysis object selected is Transient. This gives the
ability to implement our own code to define the analysis
sub-incrementation.</p>
<h3 id="elasto_plastic_gravity_step">Elasto-plastic Gravity Step</h3>
<p>The same analysis objects are used for the elasto-plastic gravity
step. The materialstage is updated to simulate elastoplastic response
(one more time this applies only to PressureDependMultiYield,
PressureDependMultiYield02, PressureInDependMultiYield models) :</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt;
updateMaterialStage -material 1 -stage 1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The command above specifies that material 1 should behave according
to stage flag 1, which is a elasto-plastic state.</p>
<h3 id="elasto_plastic_dynamic_step">Elasto-plastic Dynamic Step</h3>
<p>The load is applied using a very simple command:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; pattern
UniformExcitation 1 1 -accel $Timeseries_1; &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>This command creates a UniformExcitation object with tag 1, which
applies to all the nodes in direction 1(x), an acceleration pattern
(-accel) defined by the value of the parameter $Timeseries_1. If one
defines more than one objects of this type, the results would be
superimposed. The output of this analysis would be relative relative to
the displacement of these nodes (i.e. the nodes fixed in direction 1
will have as output zero accelerations).</p>
<p>The analysis objects need to be defined:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set
gamma 0.65</p>
<ol>
<li>create the SOE, ConstraintHandler, Integrator, Algorithm and
Numberer</li>
</ol>
<p>integrator Newmark $gamma [expr pow($gamma+0.5, 2)/4] 0.00 0.0 0.0002
0.0</p>
<p>constraints Transformation</p>
<p>algorithm Newton</p>
<p>numberer RCM</p>
<p>system ProfileSPD</p>
<p>analysis Transient &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The above command creates a Newmark integrator with gamma=0.65, which
adds some minor numerical damping. Also, some minor Rayleigh damping is
added. This is a good compromise between accuracy and numerical
stability for this part of the analysis. The rest of the analysis is
kept the same with the gravity analysis.</p>
<p>During the analysis recorder objects are used to track pore
pressures, effective stresses, accelerations, and displacements.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set r_1
[recorder Node -file output_disp_11.txt -nodeRange 1 4204 -time -dT 0.05
-dof 1 2 disp]</p>
<p>set r_2 [recorder Node -file output_accel_11.txt -nodeRange 1 4204
-time -dT 0.05 -dof 1 2 accel]</p>
<p>set r_3 [recorder Node -file output_pore_11.txt -nodeRange 1 4204
-time -dT 0.05 -dof 3 vel]</p>
<p>set r_4 [recorder Element -file stress_1_11.txt -time -dT 0.05
-eleRange 1 3932 material 1 stress]</p>
<p>set r_8 [recorder Element -file strain_1_11.txt -time -dT 0.05
-eleRange 1 3932 material 1 strain] &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>In the above code, five types of recorders are illustrated, the
displacement, the acceleration, the pore pressure, the stress, and the
strain recorders. We note that the strain and stress values are
extracted from the material class, so different implementations of
materials might not include these recorders. Parameters r_1, r_2, r_3,
r_4 have handles to the created recorder objects.</p>
<p>Later in the analysis we can conveniently destroy the recorders:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; remove
recorder $r_1 &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>The above command destroys the recorder object with tag the value of
the parameter r_1. This is done to store different parts of the analysis
to different output files.</p>
<p>Next, a sample of the code that allows for control on the
incrementation of the solution procedure is presented:</p>
<p>&lt;pre style="background:yellow;color:black;width:800px"&gt; set ok
0</p>
<p>set currentTime 0.0</p>
<p>set i_extr_nl 0.0</p>
<p>set dt 0.005</p>
<p>set i_suc 0</p>
<p>set disp_incr 1.0e-5</p>
<p>set iter 30</p>
<p>algorithm Newton</p>
<p>while {$currentTime &lt; 13.} {</p>
<p>test EnergyIncr $disp_incr $iter 2;</p>
<p>set ok [analyze 1 $dt]</p>
<p>set currentTime [getTime]</p>
<p>puts "$ok dt=$dt Disp_incr=$disp_incr #Iter=$iter"</p>
<p>if {$ok ==0} {</p>
<p>set i_suc [expr $i_suc+1]</p>
<p>if {$disp_incr&gt;1e-3} {</p>
<p>set i_extr_nl [expr $i_extr_nl+1]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>if {$i_suc&gt;10} {</p>
<p>set disp_incr [expr $disp_incr/2]</p>
<p>if {$disp_incr&lt;1e-6} {</p>
<p>set disp_incr 1e-6</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>if {$dt&lt;0.0005} {</p>
<p>set iter 30</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>if {$i_suc&gt;20} {</p>
<p>set dt [expr $dt*2]</p>
<p>if {$dt&gt;0.05} {</p>
<p>set dt 0.05</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>if {$ok !=0} {</p>
<p>set dt [expr $dt/2]</p>
<p>if {$i_suc==0} {</p>
<p>set disp_incr [expr $disp_incr*2]</p>
<p>if {$disp_incr&gt;0.005} {</p>
<p>set disp_incr 0.005</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>if {$dt&lt;0.0005} {</p>
<p>set iter 200</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>set i_suc 0</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>} &lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>In the above algorithm we try to evaluate a step using an initial
time-step. In case of non-convergence the algorithm changes the
convergence criteria and the time-step so that the analysis converges.
In case of convergence, the algorithm increases the time-step and
tightens the convergence criteria up to some pre-specified limits. This
part of the code should always be tailored according to accuracy and
speed needs of every analysis.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Three phases of shaking and dissipation are allowed in the happen in
the model. A full analysis of the example file, will take around a day,
depending on the processor speed. A sample output, after the end of all
the shaking and dissipation of all the accumulated excess pore pressure,
produced with GiD is shown below.</p>
