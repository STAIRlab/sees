# SparseGEN (SuperLU)

<p>This command is used to construct a SparseGEN linear system of
equation object. As the name implies, this class is used for sparse
matrix systems. The solution of the sparse matrix is carried out using

command is used to construct such a system:</p>

```tcl
system SparseGEN
```
