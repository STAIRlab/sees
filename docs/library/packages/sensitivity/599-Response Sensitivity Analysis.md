# Response Sensitivity Analysis

<p>This manual is intended to outline the basic commands currently
available within the OpenSees interpreter for performing DDM-based
response sensitivity analysis. This interpreter is an extension of the
Tcl/Tk language for use with OpenSees. The existing Tcl commands for
Finite Element response-only computation are described in the OpenSees
user’s guide available online at <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu">http://opensees.berkeley.edu</a>
and, thus, are not repeated in this document. The notation used herein
is the same as that used in the Tcl commands manual for response-only
computation. Only new Tcl commands for DDM-based response sensitivity
computation are presented and explained in detail.</p>
<p>This manual is subdivided as follows:</p>
