<hr />
<p>This example demonstrates how to conduct a calibration of a viscous
damper using the maxwell model.</p>

here:</p>

<p>The viscous damper is modeled with the <a
href="Force-Based_Beam-Column_Element" title="wikilink">Force-Based
Beam-Column element</a>. This element follow a <a
href="Maxwell_Material" title="wikilink"> Maxwell</a> hysteretic
response. An idealized schematic of the model is presented in Figure
1.</p>
<p>The units of the model are mm, N, and seconds.</p>
<h3 id="basic_geometry">Basic Geometry</h3>
<p>The basic geometry of the viscous damper is defined by input
variables for the length L=5000mm, and area A =
12000mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Two nodes are used for the geometry of
the damper.</p>
<h3 id="damper_section">Damper Section</h3>
<p>A square section is used to define the area A of the damper
(A&lt;sub&gt;damper&lt;/sub&gt; =
12000.0mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).</p>
<h3 id="damper_links">Damper Links</h3>
<p><a href="Force-Based_Beam-Column_Element"
title="wikilink">Force-Based Beam-Column elements</a> are used to link
the two nodes that define the geometry of the viscous damper with n=5
sections of integration and the damper section defined previously.</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<p>Node 1 is pinned. A roller is assigned to node 2</p>
<h3 id="maxwell_material">Maxwell Material</h3>
<p>To model the viscous damper the <a href="Maxwell_Material"
title="wikilink"> Maxwell</a> is used. The input parameters that are
selected for the damper example are as follows: Axial Stiffness K =
500000.0 N/mm, Viscous Coefficient C=100000.0
N(s/mm)&lt;sup&gt;0.30&lt;/sup&gt; and exponent a=0.30.</p>
<h3 id="loading">Loading</h3>
<p>The viscous damper is loaded with a displacement history that is
called Damper.txt in the axial loading direction. A linear pattern is
selected and the node of application is Node 2.</p>
<h3 id="recorders">Recorders</h3>
<p>The <a href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">recorders</a> used in
this example include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">localForce
recorder</a> to track the axial force of the viscous damper</li>
<li>The <a href="Recorder_Command" title="wikilink">stressStrain
recorder</a> to track the stress and strain history of the viscous
damper in section 3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>In order to calibrate the viscous damper a multiple support
excitation option is selected with application of displacement as the
imposed motion. This is necessary since an integration step dt should be
specified for integration of strain histories for each time step.</p>

<p>The force - displacement relationship from the maxwell damper are
shown in Figure 2. In order to obtain the displacement of the damper we
multiply the strain in section 3 of the damper times the length
L=5000mm. A comparison of the response with a MATLAB based script is
also shown in the same figure. Results are identical.</p>
