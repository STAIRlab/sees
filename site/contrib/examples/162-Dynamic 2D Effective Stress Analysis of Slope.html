<p>This article describes the OpenSees implementation of an effective
stress analysis of a slope which is subject to a seismic event. The
slope is modeled in two-dimensions and it is assumed that the slope is
underlain by an elastic half-space. The free-field response of the soil
is considered through the use of massive columns of soil with periodic
boundary conditions located at both ends of the model. Nine-node
quadrilateral elements with both displacement and pore pressure degrees
of freedom enable the model to track changes in pore pressure and
effective stress during the course of the analysis. A Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer
(1969) dashpot is utilized to account for the finite rigidity of the
underlying elastic medium.</p>
<p>This article also discusses the use of the tool <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a> as a means for post-process
visualization of the results of the analysis. Files are provided which
convert the recorded output from OpenSees into a format which can be
read by GiD and the processes behind this are briefly discussed. The
pre-processing capabilities of GiD, and the application of these
capabilities to the generation of the input file for this example, are
discussed in a separate example, <a

&lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt;</p>
<p>The analysis discussed in this article is for the site shown in Fig.
1 above. There are several layers of cohesive and cohesionless material
which make up this site, and the site is partially submerged below a
body of water. The groundwater table in the portion of the site away
from Puget Sound is assumed to have a constant elevation. The entire
site is underlain by an elastic half-space, allowing some of the energy
imparted by the seismic event to be removed from the site in a manner
consistent with the existence of layer of bedrock below the slope site.
The elastic half-space is modeled using a Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969)
dashpot in a similar manner to that used in the effective and total
stress site response examples posted in the <a href="OpenSees_User"
title="wikilink">Practical Examples</a> section of this manual.</p>
<h3 id="mesh_geometry">Mesh Geometry</h3>
<p>The input file for this example analysis, <a
href="Media:slopeAnalysis2Deff.tcl"
title="wikilink">slopeAnalysis2Deff.tcl</a>, was generated using the GiD
problemtype UWnineQuad2Dup.gid, which is provided and discussed in a
separate example, <a
href="GiD_ProblemTypes_for_2D_Slope_Analysis_Input_File_Generation"
title="wikilink">GiD ProblemTypes for 2D Slope Analysis Input File
Generation</a>. Using this problemtype, it is possible to create the
mesh geometry visually in GiD, and export this information, along with
additional conditions such as nodal fixities and material assignments,
into an input file which can be read by OpenSees. Further details into
this process can be found in the <a
href="GiD_ProblemTypes_for_2D_Slope_Analysis_Input_File_Generation"
title="wikilink">GiD ProblemTypes for 2D Slope Analysis Input File
Generation</a> example.</p>
<p>The mesh created for this example using GiD as a pre-processor is
shown in Fig. 2. The use of the GiD tool greatly simplifies
mesh-generation for 2D problems as compared to creating the nodes using
loops inside the input file. The benefit is especially evident when mesh
modifications or refinement are necessary.</p>

&lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt;</p>
<p>The formulation of the nine-node quadrilateral elements used in this
example necessitates care in the number of degrees of freedom which are
currently in the domain when defining certain aspects of the model. The
corner nodes of the elements must be created in a domain which considers
three degrees of freedom, while the interior nodes of the elements must
be created in a domain which considers only two degrees of freedom. This
is also true of the fixities, masses, and loads applied to these two
sets of nodes. Further discussion on the nine-node quadrilateral
elements is available in the example, <a
href="Effective_Stress_Site_Response_Analysis_of_a_Layered_Soil_Column"
title="wikilink">Effective Stress Site Response Analysis of a Layered
Soil Column</a>.</p>
<h3 id="boundary_conditions">Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>The nodes at the base of the mesh are fixed against vertical
translation only. The technique used to model the underlying elastic
half-space necessitates that these nodes be left free to displace in the
horizontal direction, however, the nodes on the base of the model are
all given <a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF</a> for
horizontal displacements. The pore pressure degree of freedom is fixed
for all nodes on the upper boundary of the model and/or above the
groundwater table. Fixing this degree of freedom creates a drainage path
for the water in the adjacent elements and restricts the pore pressure
in these locations to zero. These two sets of boundary conditions are
the only fixities applied to the model.</p>
<p>In the horizontal direction, the model only represents a small
section of a presumably infinite (or at least very large) soil domain.
To ensure that free-field conditions exist at the horizontal boundaries
of the model, the elements in these locations (the free-field columns
indicated in red in Fig. 1) are given increased thickness to ensure that
they are significantly more massive than the elements in the interior of
the mesh, and the displacement degrees of freedom for the nodes on
either side of these columns are tied together using <a
href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF</a> to create periodic
boundary conditions. When the horizontal excitation is applied to the
model, the reaction of these massive columns should be the free-field
response. To ensure that the critical portions of the model, such as the
slope in this example, are not affected by the horizontal boundaries,
the free-field columns must be located sufficiently far away from the
critical regions.</p>
<h3 id="material_and_element_definitions">Material and Element
Definitions</h3>
<p>The soil constitutive behavior is modeled using the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1551.htm">PressureDependMultiYield02</a>
nDMaterial object for the cohesionless material and the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1558.htm">PressureIndependMultiYield</a>
nDMaterial object for the cohesive material.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The mass density input values for the material
objects should be total mass densities, i.e. above the groundwater
table, the mass density should reflect dry or moist conditions, and
below the groundwater table, the mass density should be the saturated
value. For elements with free pore pressure degrees of freedom (those
below the water table), the 9_4_QuadUP element computes the effective
mass density using the input value from the material object and the
fluid mass density specified during the element generation.</p>
<p>Included with the material definitions for each soil layer are
additional parameters which are used by the 9_4_QuadUP element. These
include the element thickness, the horizontal and vertical body forces
on the element, the undrained bulk modulus, and the horizontal and
vertical permeabilities. Each layer of soil is given appropriate values
for these parameters. The elements in the free-field columns are given
increased thickness here.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Gravity must be incorporated into an analysis
using the 9_4_QuadUP element in a manner which differs from that used
for the standard four node <a href="Quad_Element" title="wikilink">quad
element</a>. With the four node quad element, gravity is typically
considered through the use of body forces which represent the unit
weight of the soil. In the case of the nine node quad element, the body
forces should not be the unit weights, instead they should have
magnitudes equal to the components of gravity only.</p>
<p>The 9_4_QuadUP element should be defined in the following manner:</p>
<figure>

undrained bulk modulus, &lt;tt&gt;fMass&lt;/tt&gt; is the fluid mass
density, &lt;tt&gt;hPerm&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;vPerm&lt;/tt&gt; are
the horizontal and vertical permeabilites, and
&lt;tt&gt;hBody&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;vBody&lt;/tt&gt; are the
horizontal and vertical body forces. The nodal connectivity pattern
matches that shown in Fig. 3. The creators of the 9_4_QuadUP element
recommend an undrained bulk modulus which is equal to the bulk modulus
of the fluid (2.2e6 kPa for water) divided by the porosity of the soil
layer. In this example, the fluid is water, therefore, the fluid mass
density for each layer is set to 1.0 Mg/m^3.</p>
<p>The permeabilities for all of the elements are initially set to 1.0
m/s to ensure that hydrostatic conditions exist after the application of
gravity in the model. If the permeability of a particular layer is too
low, it may take many gravity analysis steps in order to reach
hydrostatic pressure conditions. Prior to the application of the ground
motion, the permeabilities of each soil layer are updated using the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1560.htm">updateParameter</a>
command to their respective assigned values so pore pressure generation
during the horizontal excitation is captured appropriately. The usage of
the updateParameter command seems to differ from that documented <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1560.htm">here</a>.
Parameter tags must be defined for each permeability parameter
(horizontal and vertical) for each element. Then these tags can be used
to update the corresponding parameters. &lt;br style="clear: both"
/&gt;</p>
<p>An example of the parameter update process for two elements is
provided here. To set the parameter tags:</p>
<ol>
<li>tag eleTag parameterType</li>
</ol>
<p>parameter 10001 element 1 vPerm parameter 10002 element 1 hPerm
parameter 10003 element 2 vPerm parameter 10004 element 2 hPerm To
update the permeability parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>tag parameterValue</li>
</ol>
<p>updateParameter 10001 1.0e-4 updateParameter 10002 1.0e-4
updateParameter 10003 1.0e-5 updateParameter 10004 1.0e-5 It seems to
help to make the parameter tags different from any of the other tags
used in the model (e.g. material, element tags), hence the numbers in
this example start at 10001 and increase incrementally. As might be
expected, the parameter tags must be defined before the parameters can
be updated.</p>
<h3 id="lysmer_dashpot_definition">Lysmer Dashpot Definition</h3>
<p>A single <a href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">zeroLength
element</a> is used to define the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot. One
end of the dashpot element is fixed against all displacements, while the
other is given <a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF</a>
with the soil node in the lower left hand corner of the model. The node
in the lower left hand corner of the model is the master node for the
horizontal <a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF</a>
assigned to the nodes at the base of the mesh.</p>
<p>The <a href="Viscous_Material" title="wikilink"> viscous uniaxial
material</a> is used to define the constitutive behavior of the
Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot in the horizontal direction. This
material model requires a single input, the dashpot coefficient,
&lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt;. Following the method of Joyner and Chen (1975),
the dashpot coefficient is defined as the product of the mass density
and shear wave velocity of the underlying medium, which, in this
example, is assumed to have the properties of bedrock. The dashpot
coefficient must be scaled by the area of the base of the model to
ensure that equivalent loading is applied.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This area factor must take into account the
increased thickness of the free-field columns and must be entered
manually into the input file via the variable,
&lt;tt&gt;$baseArea&lt;/tt&gt; ; GiD does not calculate this factor.</p>
<h3 id="incorporating_the_body_of_water_into_the_model">Incorporating
the Body of Water into the Model</h3>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1, a portion of the site modeled in this example is
submerged beneath Puget Sound. To incorporate the dynamic effects of the
water on the site without altering the effective stresses in the soil
elements, each node on the boundary of the mesh which is below the body
of water is assigned a nodal mass using the <a href="Mass_Command"
title="wikilink">mass</a> command. For the nodes on the level surface,
the horizontal mass is set to zero and the vertical mass is set as the
mass of the volume of water 'supported' by the node. For each respective
node, this volume is bounded by the depth of water above the node, half
the distance to adjacent nodes, and the element thickness. The nodes on
the slope are assigned horizontal and vertical mass components based on
the geometry of the slope.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These values must be manually input in to the
analysis, GiD does not automatically calculate them. Also, care must be
taken as to how many degrees of freedom exist at each node. In this
example, the nodes with three degrees of freedom are assigned masses
separately from the nodes with two degrees of freedom.</p>
<h3 id="gravity_analysis_and_recorders">Gravity Analysis and
Recorders</h3>
<p>The first step in the analysis is to apply gravity to the model. This
ensures that the distributions of pore pressure and effective stresses
in the model are appropriate for the site conditions prior to the
application of a ground motion. Separate recorders are set up so the
gravity analysis information is distinct from any post-gravity results.
Nodal displacements, accelerations, and pore pressures are recorded
along with the elemental stresses and strains at each of the nine Gauss
points.</p>
<p>The gravity analysis is conducted in two parts. In the first part,
the soil elements are considered to be linear elastic. This is
accomplished by setting the material stage to be zero for each material
object using the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1559.htm">updateMaterialStage</a>
command. The second part of the gravity analysis considers elastoplastic
constitutive behavior by setting updating the material stage to one for
each material object.</p>
<p>The elastic portion of the gravity analysis is run as a <a
href="analysis_Command" title="wikilink">transient analysis</a> with
very large time steps, thus simulating a static analysis while avoiding
the conflicts which may occur when mixing static and transient analyses.
Gravity is applied for 10 steps with a time step of 500, and 10 steps
with a timestep of 5000. This is done to ensure that hydrostatic pore
pressure conditions are achieved. The plastic portion of the gravity
analysis is run using smaller time steps to aid in convergence, and
because drastic, free-vibration causing displacements, do not typically
occur in this stage of the analysis.</p>
<h3 id="horizontal_analysis_and_recorders">Horizontal Analysis and
Recorders</h3>
<p>Using the method of Joyner and Chen (1975), dynamic excitation is
applied as a force time history to the base of the soil column, at the
node which shares equal degrees-of-freedom with the Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer
(1969) dashpot. This force history is obtained by multiplying the
velocity time history of the recorded ground motion by the mass density
and shear wave velocity of the underlying bedrock layer and the area of
the base of the model (This factor is the same as the previously
discussed dashpot coefficient). This technique considers the finite
rigidity of the underlying layer by allowing energy to be radiated back
into the underlying material.</p>
<p>The force history is applied to the model as a <a
href="Path_TimeSeries" title="wikilink">Path TimeSeries</a> object using
a <a href="Plain_Pattern" title="wikilink">Plain load pattern</a>
object. The actual force applied to the node in each time step is the
product of the load factor indicated in the pattern object, the
additional load factor included in the timeSeries object, and the value
found in the file, velocityHistory.out, at that time step. The load
factor included in the timeSeries object is used to create a force
history from the velocity history found in the namesake file.</p>
<p>The same items that are recorded during the gravity analysis are
recorded here, the only difference is the file names are different so
that the two analyses are recorded separately. The recorder time step is
set as twice the analysis time step to reduce the size of the output
files.</p>
<p>For improved success in completing the analysis in a timely manner, a
convergence loop is included in the input file. If convergence is not
reached, the time step is reduced in half and the analysis continues.
The loop is set such that this process can occur twice before the
analysis is deemed over. If the user encounters a problem where two
reductions in the initial time step do not create a time step small
enough for convergence, it is recommended that a smaller initial time
step be set.</p>
<p>The remaining details of the analysis are very similar to those
discussed in the <a
href="Site_Response_Analysis_of_a_Layered_Soil_Column_(Total_Stress_Analysis)"
title="wikilink"> Total Stress Site Response Analysis of a Layered Soil
Column</a> and <a

<h2 id="post_processing_of_results_in_gid">Post-Processing of Results in
<a href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a></h2>
<p>Visualization of the results of a 2D analysis, such as that presented
in this article, can be accomplished using the GiD tool. Any quantity
that is recorded at a node (e.g. displacement) or a Gauss point (e.g.
stress) can be read into GiD as post-process results. GiD is then able
to produce various plots and animations with which to evaluate the
results of the analysis. Information on how to use the post-processing
capabilities of GiD for this purpose can be found in the <a
href="http://gid.cimne.com/support/manuals">GiD manuals</a>.</p>
<p>For the purposes of efficiency, the post-processing in GiD is
conducted under the assumption that the data corresponds to four node
quadrilateral elements. The nine node quadrilateral elements used in
this example only have pore pressure degrees of freedom at the corner
nodes. In order to visualize contour plots of pore pressure in GiD for
nine node elements, it is required that pore pressure values be assigned
to every node in the element. It is not difficult to map the pore
pressures to the interior nodes using the values at the corner nodes,
however, there are many elements and many time steps, and this process
would become very expensive computationally. Instead of taking this
approach, only the recorded nodal quantities at the corner nodes and the
recorded elemental quantities at the corner Gauss points are used for
post-process visualizations. This is accomplished by creating a
post-process mesh which shares the geometry of the original mesh, but
for which the elements only have four nodes. While this approach
somewhat alters the resolution of the data as recorded from the nine
node elements, it is sufficient for the purpose of visualization.</p>
<p>Several <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> scripts have
been provided which sort the output from the OpenSees recorders into a
format that can be read into GiD. These files, flaviaWriter.m,
dispFlavia.m, porePressFlavia.m, ppRatioFlavia.m, and stressFlavia.m,
are available for download with the rest of the files for this example
<a href="Media:_slopeAnalysis2Dexample.zip" title="wikilink"> here</a>.
This series of files creates a GiD post-process results file given the
default name &lt;tt&gt;renameMe.flavia.res&lt;/tt&gt; by running the
main file, flaviaWriter.m in Matlab. The individual quantities such as
displacement, pore pressure, and stress are handled by separate
functions, allowing the user to only write a results file for quantities
of interest. The flaviaWriter.m function requires several input
arguments. In order, these are the material type as a string ('elastic'
for elasticIsotropic material, 'PDMY' for pressureDependMultiYield or
pressureDependMultiYield02, 'PIMY' for pressureIndependMultiYield, or
'J2' for J2Plasticity), the analysis time step, and the number of
gravity steps used in the analysis. These arguments ensure that the
results are correctly integrated into the post-process results file.</p>
<p>A post-process mesh file is generated automatically by the input file
for the slope analysis as generated by the UWnineQuad2Dup problemtype
discussed in the <a
href="GiD_ProblemTypes_for_2D_Slope_Analysis_Input_File_Generation"
title="wikilink">GiD ProblemTypes for 2D Slope Analysis Input File
Generation</a> example. This file simply lists the nodes with their
locations and the elements with their nodal connectivities. The
post-process mesh file which is created is given the default name
&lt;tt&gt;renameMe.flavia.msh&lt;/tt&gt;.</p>
<p>To visualize the results in GiD, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the analysis in OpenSees.</li>
<li>Generate the post-process results file using the supplied Matlab
scripts.</li>
<li>Save a blank project in GiD with any desired name (e.g.
&lt;tt&gt;slopeAnalysis.gid&lt;/tt&gt;).</li>
<li>Place the post-process mesh and results files
(&lt;tt&gt;renameMe.flavia.msh&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt&gt;renameMe.flavia.res&lt;/tt&gt;) in the GiD project
directory.</li>
<li>Change the names to match the project name (e.g.
&lt;tt&gt;slopeAnalysis.flavia.msh&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt&gt;slopeAnalysis.flavia.res&lt;/tt&gt;).</li>
<li>Open the project and enter post-process mode.</li>

<h2 id="representative_results">Representative Results</h2>
<p>The slope analysis of this example was intended to evaluate the
stability of the slope after the development of cyclic mobility in the
loose sand layer. The ability of the model to capture the development of
this cyclic mobility is demonstrated here for three purposes: (1) to
demonstrate the ability of OpenSees to model this type of behavior, (2)
to demonstrate the post-processing capabilities of GiD, and (3) as a
means to verify the proper download and implementation of the example
files.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows the shear stress-strain response for the center Gauss
point of two elements from the loose sand layer of the model. One of the
elements is located just in front of the toe of the slope, and the other
is located somewhat below the top of the slope. As shown, it appears
that cyclic mobility occurs at the slope toe location, as the shear
strains become very large and plastic behavior is clearly visible, while
it does not appear to occur at the other location, where the response
remains largely elastic. For verification purposes, the two elements in
these plots are elements 458 (slope top) and 729 (slope toe). &lt;br

<p>To verify the presence of cyclic mobility in the model, the pore
pressure ratios, taken as the ratio of the excess pore pressure to the
initial vertical effective stress, at several locations in the loose
sand layer are examined. Fig. 5 shows these computed ratios. As shown,
at the two locations in front of the slope toe, the pore pressure ratios
reach 1.0, indicating the initiation of initial liquefaction. The
observed pore pressure behavior corresponds well with the behavior
observed in the shear stress strain response. The considered locations
range between the middle of the slope to in front of the toe of the
slope. For verification purposes, these nodes are numbers 747, 914, 996,
and 1079. Fig. 6 shows a contour plot of the slope region during the
strongest portion of the applied ground motions. As shown, the largest
pore pressure ratios develop in front of the slope toe where the
vertical effective stress is at a minimum for this layer.</p>

<p>To demonstrate how the observed initiation of liquefaction affects
the stability of the slope, a second analysis was conducted in which the
permeabilities of the layers were increased. In this analysis, large
excess pore pressures do not develop and cyclic mobility is not
observed. A comparison of the displacement histories of several nodes
inside the loose sand layer in each analysis is shown in Fig. 7. In this
plot, the original analysis (with cyclic mobility) is represented as
solid lines, while the second analysis (without cyclic mobility) is
represented using dashed lines. As shown, for all of the locations the
displacements which develop for the case where liquefaction occurred are
larger. The response of the node which is to the left of the slope is
only slightly different, however, the period-elongating effects of the
liquefaction can be observed. For verification purposes, the plotted
nodes are numbers 1009, 1301, 1755, and 2713. &lt;br style="clear: both"
