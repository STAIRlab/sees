# Sp Command

<p>This command is used to construct a single-point constraint object
and add it to the enclosing LoadPattern.</p>

```tcl
sp $nodeTag $dofTag $dofValue
```
<hr />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>$nodeTag</strong></p></td>
<td><p>tag of node to which constraint is applied.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>$dofTag</strong></p></td>
<td><p>the degree-of-freedom at the node to which constraint is applied
(1 through ndf)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>$dofValue</strong></p></td>
<td><p>reference constraint value.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<ol>
<li>The $dofValue is a reference value, it is the time series that
provides the load factor. The load factor times the reference</li>
</ol>
<p>value is the constraint that is actually applied to the node.</p>
