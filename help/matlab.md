# Matlab

In order to install the Matlab bindings, open Matlab in a
directory containing the files `render.py` and `render.m`,
and run the following command in the Matlab interpreter:

    render --install

Once this process is complete, the command `render` can be
called from Matlab, just as described below for the command
line.
