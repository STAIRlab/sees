<p>This article describes the OpenSees implementation of an effective
stress site response analysis of a layered deposit of cohesionless soil
underlain by an elastic half-space. A single column of soil is modeled
in 2D (with periodic boundary conditions to emulate a 1D analysis) and
is subject to an earthquake excitation. Nine node quadrilateral elements
with both displacement and pore pressure degrees of freedom enable the
model to track changes in pore pressure and effective stress during the
earthquake excitation. A Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot is utilized to
account for the finite rigidity of the underlying elastic medium.</p>
<p>This article also briefly introduces the user to the pre- and
post-process visualization tool <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a>. Specifically, the means to
generate GiD-compatible results from the data returned by the OpenSees
recorders are provided and discussed. GiD is a powerful tool for
visualizing data and generating meshes, among other things. It is
especially helpful when working with 2D and 3D problems in OpenSees. The
GiD tool can be downloaded from <a

This article will emphasize the attributes which are particular to the
effective stress analysis. The user is referred to the total stress
example for further information on details which may be omitted or
quickly explained here.</p>
<p>Provided with this article are several files. Files which are
required for the analysis are indicated. The files include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The example input file, <a href="freeFieldEffective.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldEffective.tcl</a> (<strong>required for
analysis</strong>)</li>
<li>The velocity time history of the selected earthquake record,

<p>For further information into a site response analysis using OpenSees,
the user is referred to the previously-mentioned <a

the large set of examples developed at the University of California at
San Diego available at <a
href="http://cyclic.ucsd.edu/opensees">http://cyclic.ucsd.edu/opensees</a>.
These examples utilize a wide variety of element and material
formulations, as well as different boundary and loading conditions than
those used in this example.</p>

alt="Fig 1. Layered soil profile with 2% slope modeled by the example discussed in this article. The flat soil profile is the same, only without a slope." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 1. Layered soil profile with 2% slope
modeled by the example discussed in this article. The flat soil profile
is the same, only without a slope.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The site response analysis discussed in this article is for a soil
profile consisting of a 10 m thick layer of loose sand (Dr = 40%) above
a 20 m thick layer of more dense sand (Dr = 75%). The profile is assumed
to be on an infinite slope with a 2% grade. A schematic representation
of the analyzed soil profile is shown in Fig. 1. The entire soil profile
is underlain by an elastic half-space which represents the finite
rigidity of an underlying medium such as bedrock. The groundwater table
is located at a depth of 2 m, therefore, saturated unit weights are used
for the soil below this point and effective stress analysis is
considered through the use of nine-node quadrilateral elements which are
able to simulate fluid-solid coupling.</p>
<h3 id="mesh_geometry">Mesh Geometry</h3>
<p>The general layout of the model is similar to that discussed in the
previously-posted <a
href="Site_Response_Analysis_of_a_Layered_Soil_Column_(Total_Stress_Analysis)"
title="wikilink"> total stress site response analysis example</a>,
however, the elements have nine nodes instead of four. A single
nine-node element is shown in Fig. 2 to demonstrate the layout of the
nodes and the order of element connectivity. The corner nodes (shown in
blue in Fig. 2) have three degrees of freedom, two translational and one
pore pressure, and the interior nodes (red in Fig. 2) have only two
translational degrees of freedom.</p>
<figure>
<img src="nineNodeElem.png"
title="Fig 2. Nine node quadrilateral element."
alt="Fig 2. Nine node quadrilateral element." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 2. Nine node quadrilateral
element.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The implementation of the nine node quadrilateral element requires
that the two types of nodes, and their corresponding fixities, be
created in an appropriate domain. The pore pressure nodes their fixities
must be preceded by the command model BasicBuilder -ndm 2 -ndf 3,
indicating that the domain has 2 dimensions and 3 degrees of freedom.
The interior nodes and corresponding fixities must be preceded by the
command model BasicBuilder -ndm 2 -ndf 2, indicating that the domain has
2 dimensions and 2 degrees of freedom. The node and fixity definitions
are the only major aspects of the model for which care must be taken
with respect to the domain, however, since the load is applied to a
corner node during the dynamic analysis, the correct domain must be
redefined prior to the definition of the loading object.</p>
<p>The example analysis provided in the file <a
href="freeFieldEffective.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldEffective.tcl</a> is set-up in a manner such
that the user need only define the geometry of the soil profile and
groundwater table (<strong>Note:</strong> if the ground water table is
not located at the surface, an additional soil layer must be included to
differentiate the dry or moist soil above the gwt from the saturated
soil below the gwt). The nodes are generated automatically based on the
input geometry information. The input file is also set up such that
different vertical element sizes can be used within each soil layer.</p>
<h3 id="boundary_conditions">Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>The appropriate boundary conditions are also automatically generated
based on the input geometry. The nodes at the base of the soil column
are fixed against vertical translation and the pore pressure nodes above
the groundwater table are fixed in the pore pressure dof (representing
an open drainage condition). Periodic boundary conditions are assumed
for the purposes of mimicking a 1D analysis. This is done though the use
of the <a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF command</a>.
For the periodic boundary condition, each of the nodes which share the
same vertical location are given equal translational degrees of freedom.
<strong>Note:</strong> The pore pressure degrees of freedom for corner
nodes at a particular vertical location should not be linked using the
<a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF command</a>.
Through the creation of this example, it was found that this can cause
problems in the analysis.</p>
<h3 id="material_and_element_definitions">Material and Element
Definitions</h3>
<p>The soil constitutive behavior is modeled using the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1551.htm">PressureDependMultiYield02</a>
nDMaterial object. Since no attempt was made to model an actual soil
deposit, the material parameters are based upon the recommended table of
parameters available on the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1551.htm">PressureDependMultiYield02</a>
page for the appropriate relative densities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The mass density input values for the material
objects should be total mass densities, i.e. above the groundwater
table, the mass density should reflect dry or moist conditions, and
below the groundwater table, the mass density should be the saturated
value. For elements with free pore pressure degrees of freedom (those
below the water table), the 9_4_QuadUP element computes the effective
mass density using the input value from the material object and the
fluid mass density specified during the element generation.</p>
<p>Included with the material definitions for each soil layer are
additional parameters which are used by the 9_4_QuadUP element. These
include the element thickness, the horizontal and vertical body forces
on the element, the undrained bulk modulus, and the horizontal and
vertical permeabilities. The example is set-up such that these values
can vary from layer to layer. The creators of the 9_4_QuadUP element
recommend an undrained bulk modulus which is equal to the bulk modulus
of the fluid (2.2e6 kPa for water) divided by the porosity of the soil
layer. For the layer above the groundwater table, a small value (5e-6
kPa) is used as the undrained bulk modulus.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Gravity must be incorporated into an analysis
using the 9_4_QuadUP element in a manner which differs from that used
for the standard four node <a href="Quad_Element" title="wikilink">quad
element</a>. With the four node quad element, gravity is typically
considered through the use of body forces which represent the unit
weight of the soil. In the case of the nine node quad element, the body
forces should not be the unit weights, instead they should have
magnitudes equal to the components of gravity only, i.e. for an analysis
of level ground using SI units, the vertical body force should be -9.81
and the horizontal body force should be zero. The infinite slope
conditions of this example are modeled by using horizontal and vertical
gravity components computed from the angle of the sloping ground as the
body forces acting on the elements.</p>
<p>The 9_4_QuadUP elements are created automatically based on the input
soil geometry and the material definitions. The 9_4_QuadUP element
should be defined in the following manner: element 9_4_QuadUP eleID
nodei nodej nodek nodel nodem noden nodep nodeq noder thickness matID
uBulk fMass hPerm vPerm hBody vBody where &lt;tt&gt;uBulk&lt;/tt&gt; is
the undrained bulk modulus, &lt;tt&gt;fMass&lt;/tt&gt; is the fluid mass
density, &lt;tt&gt;hPerm&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;vPerm&lt;/tt&gt; are
the horizontal and vertical permeabilites, and
&lt;tt&gt;hBody&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;vBody&lt;/tt&gt; are the
horizontal and vertical body forces. The nodal connectivity pattern
matches that shown in Fig. 2. In this example, the fluid is water,
therefore, the fluid mass density for each layer is set to 1.0
Mg/m^3.</p>
<p>The permeabilities for all of the elements are initially set to 1.0
m/s to ensure that hydrostatic conditions exist after the application of
gravity in the model. If the permeability of a particular layer is too
low, it may take many gravity analysis steps in order to reach
hydrostatic pressure conditions. Prior to the application of the ground
motion, the permeabilities of each soil layer are updated using the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1560.htm">updateParameter</a>
command to their respective assigned values so pore pressure generation
during the horizontal excitation is captured appropriately. The usage of
the updateParameter command seems to differ from that documented <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1560.htm">here</a>.
Parameter tags must be defined for each permeability parameter
(horizontal and vertical) for each element. Then these tags can be used
to update the corresponding parameters. &lt;br style="clear: both"
/&gt;</p>
<p>An example of the parameter update process for two elements is
provided here. To set the parameter tags:</p>
<ol>
<li>tag eleTag parameterType</li>
</ol>
<p>parameter 10001 element 1 vPerm parameter 10002 element 1 hPerm
parameter 10003 element 2 vPerm parameter 10004 element 2 hPerm To
update the permeability parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>tag parameterValue</li>
</ol>
<p>updateParameter 10001 1.0e-4 updateParameter 10002 1.0e-4
updateParameter 10003 1.0e-5 updateParameter 10004 1.0e-5 It seems to
help to make the parameter tags different from any of the other tags
used in the model (e.g. material, element tags), hence the numbers in
this example start at 10001 and increase incrementally. As might be
expected, the parameter tags must be defined before the parameters can
be updated. The example input file included with this article is set up
to automatically generate the parameter tags and update the permeability
parameters.</p>
<p>The Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot nodes, material, and element are
defined as described in the <a
href="Site_Response_Analysis_of_a_Layered_Soil_Column_(Total_Stress_Analysis)"
title="wikilink"> total stress site response analysis example</a> using
a bedrock shear wave velocity of 700 m/s and a bedrock mass density of
2.5 Mg/m^3.</p>
<h3 id="recorders_and_analysis">Recorders and Analysis</h3>
<p>The analysis consists of a gravity stage followed by a dynamic
excitation stage. The recorders are separated in to two groups based on
the analysis stages. The information recorded by the gravity recorders
is useful to confirm that the model has been generated properly and that
the appropriate conditions exist prior to the application of the
horizontal excitation. A good place to start when working with a new
model is the gravity phase. If the model doesn't converge or gives
incorrect results under gravity loads, then it can never be expected to
work properly in the remainder of the analysis.</p>
<p>The main details of the analysis phases are discussed in the <a
href="Site_Response_Analysis_of_a_Layered_Soil_Column_(Total_Stress_Analysis)"
title="wikilink"> total stress site response analysis example</a>,
however, there are several differences which will be discussed here. Due
to the way in which this model is constrained, it seems that use of the
<a href="Penalty_Method" title="wikilink"> penalty method</a> works
better than the <a href="Transformation_Method" title="wikilink">
transformation constraints</a> used in the total stress example. The
penalty factors specified in the example may need to be adjusted if
changes are made to the geometry or parameters. The analysis seemed to
run more smoothly using the <a href="Krylov-Newton_Algorithm"
title="wikilink"> Krylov-Newton algorithm</a> as opposed to the standard
<a href="Newton_Algorithm" title="wikilink"> Newton algorithm</a>,
however, the user is encouraged to experiment with different algorithms
for their analyses. As previously noted above, the domain must be
redefined to include three degrees of freedom prior to the definition of
the loading object since the node at which the load is applied has three
degrees of freedom. &lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt;</p>

</figure>
<p>The fluid-solid coupling modeled by the 9_4_QuadUP element allows for
the simulations of events such as liquefaction and lateral spreading. To
demonstrate these situations, two distinct analyses were performed using
the same soil profile. One analysis considers the 2% slope shown in Fig.
1 (and represented in the provided input file), and the other analysis
considers level ground conditions. The flat ground case was simulated by
setting the variable &lt;tt&gt;grade&lt;/tt&gt; located in the material
definition section of the input file to zero. In both cases, a portion
of the loose sand layer becomes liquefied during the application of the
ground motion. This fact is demonstrated in the included figures.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows the residual displacement profiles for the two
conditions after the conclusion of the ground motion. As shown, there
horizontal displacement of the upper portion of the soil column relative
to the column base differs based upon the slope of the ground. With a 2%
grade, approximately four times more relative displacement occurs,
indicative of liquefaction-induced lateral spreading.</p>
<p>Figs. 4 and 5 summarize the soil behavior at depths of 3 m (above the
liquefied zone), 7 m (in the middle of the liquefied zone), and 16 m
(below the liquefied zone) for the level ground and sloping ground
cases, respectively. These figures show the shear stress-strain
behavior, the stress paths plotted on axes of shear stress vs. vertical
effective stress, and the pore pressure ratios (computed as the ratio of
excess pore pressure to initial effective vertical stress) as they vary
with time. Included in the stress path plots are the failure and phase
transformation surfaces for each respective location.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fig 4. Summary of stress, strain, and
excess pore pressure response for three depths in the flat ground
analysis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For both ground conditions, the results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 at
a depth of 7 m are indicative of liquefaction. The pore pressure ratios
both approach 1.0 (they never seem to quite get there in any of the
simulations performed, there is likely som sort of tolerance in the
elements) over a portion of the shaking, then become reduced with
continued shaking. The stress path plots correspond, showing that the
vertical effective stresses are reduced down towards zero as the soil
liquefies, then strength is gained as the pore pressures dissipate with
further shaking. The effects of the slope can be observed in Fig. 5,
with the oscillations on the stress path plot being centered about a
point which is not the zero shear stress axis.</p>
<p>The user can confirm the correct implementation of their downloaded
version of this example by generating similar plots and comparing them
to those included here. When generating the displacement profile plot,
be sure to subtract the displacement of the base of the soil column from
the values in order to create a plot which is the equivalent of that
shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<h2 id="gid_visualization">GiD Visualization</h2>
<p>As previously discussed, several files have been included in this
article for the purpose of visualizing results in the pre- and
post-processing tool <a href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a>. The
files related to this purpose are available for download <a
href="Media:_siteResponseEffective.zip" title="wikilink"> here</a>. The
files are:</p>
<ul>
<li>freeFieldEffective.flavia.msh</li>
<li>freeFieldEffective.flavia.res</li>
<li>flaviaWriter.m script</li>
</ul>
<p>The files freeFieldEffective.flavia.msh and
freeFieldEffective.flavia.res can be used to visualize the results of
the example analysis in GiD without even running the example in
OpenSees. They were produced by running the example and provided so the
user can experiment with GiD visualization if desired. To accomplish
this, the user should take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>download and install copy of GiD</li>
<li>save a blank project with the name freeFieldEffective.gid</li>
<li>place the files freeFieldEffective.flavia.msh and
freeFieldEffective.flavia.res into the freeFieldEffective.gid
directory</li>
<li>with this project open, select the Postprocess option in the 'files'
menu</li>
</ol>
<p>The program will then load the post-processing data contained in
freeFieldEffective.flavia.msh and freeFieldEffective.flavia.res, and the
results represented in these files can be visualized in GiD.</p>
<p>The file freeFieldEffective.flavia.msh contains a list of the nodes
and elements used in the analysis in a format that GiD understands. This
file is automatically created by running the example <a
href="freeFieldEffective.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeFieldEffective.tcl</a> in OpenSees, so if
modifications are made to the mesh geometry in the example, this
information should be readily available.</p>
<p>The file freeFieldEffective.flavia.res contains the data recorded
during the analysis by the OpenSees recorders in a format that GiD can
read. The Matlab script, flaviaWriter.m, was used to convert the data
recorded during the example analysis into this format. The user can use
this Matlab script to convert the included quantities of nodal
displacement, nodal pore pressure, nodal pore pressure ratio, and
elemental stress from the OpenSees output to the proper GiD format. This
script can also be used as a template for generating additional
visualization parameters for GiD. Further information on the formats for
the *.flavia.msh and *.flavia.res can be found in the customization
manual available at <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals">http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals</a>.</p>
<p>As an example of the visualization possibilities accorded by working
with OpenSees and GiD, an animation of the soil column response during
the beginning of the excitation can be viewed <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/images/d/d4/FlatAnimation.gif">by
clicking here</a>. This animation is for the level ground case, and
shows the nodal deformations and pore pressure ratios during the dynamic
excitation. Note how the pore pressures become very high in the lower
portions of the loose sand layer during the strong shaking, then they
begin to dissipate once the strongest parts of the shaking have passed.
This is the same behavior observed at the 7 m depth in Fig. 4.</p>
<p>A future example to be posted on this site will describe the
processes involved in using GiD as a pre-processor for OpenSees. This is
especially effective for two- and three-dimensional problems. Further
information on using the post-processing capabilities will also be
discussed in this future example. &lt;br style="clear: both" /&gt;</p>
