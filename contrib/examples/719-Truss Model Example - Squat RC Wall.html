<hr />
<p>This example describes the Opensees implementation of a nonlinear
truss model for a squat shear critical wall subject to static cyclic
loading. The response of Wall WP1105-8 from Massone Sanchez (2005) is
studied in this example and the experimental and computed response will
be compared in the results.</p>

details of Wall WP1105-8 and the layout and element areas of the
corresponding Truss model.</a></p>
<p>Figure 1(a) shows the dimension and reinforcing details of Wall
WP1105-8, see Massone Sanchez (2005). The wall had an almost square
aspect ratio (54” wide and 48” tall) with longitudinal and transverse
reinforcement ratios ρw = 0.43% and ρt = 0.27%, respectively. The
compressive axial load N = 75 kips and remained constant during the
test. The lateral force was applied to the top of the wall through the
top loading beam; the loading beam was constrained from rotation.</p>
<p>For the corresponding truss model, shown in Figure 1(c), the vertical
and horizontal trusses (<strong><a href="Truss_Element"
title="wikilink">Truss</a></strong> Elements) represent the respective
reinforcing bars and their surrounding concrete in the respective
direction. The location of the outer vertical truss coincides with the
position of the outer longitudinal reinforcements with the location of
the inner trusses distributed to allow for equidistant spacing. The
areas of concrete and steel used in these elements are listed in Figure
1. The diagonal elements (<strong><a href="Truss2_Element"
title="wikilink">Truss2</a></strong> Elements) span between each node in
the model and have an effective width [b&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; as
shown in Figure 1(d)] equal to 11.2”.</p>
<p>The general application of the truss modeling approach can be found
in Panagiotou et al (2012), including the truss model for this wall
implemented in Ruaumoko and more examples of truss models for both squat
and slender walls. Lu and Panagiotou (2013) presents a 3D nonlinear
cyclic beam-truss model for non-planar walls that also uses the Truss2
element used here.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the uniaxial cyclic behavior of the vertical and
diagonal concrete material models (<strong><a
href="ConcretewBeta_Material"
title="wikilink">ConcretewBeta</a></strong> material) and the steel
material model (<strong><a
href="Steel02_Material_--_Giuffré-Menegotto-Pinto_Model_with_Isotropic_Strain_Hardening"
title="wikilink">Steel02</a></strong> material). The biaxial effect of
normal tension is considered for the diagonal elements only. Details on
the implementation and behavior of these materials can be found in their
respective pages. <a href="File:MassoneEx_fig2c.png"

<p>For the concrete used in the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal
directions, mesh objectivity is used to define the softening in
compression and tension as well as for the normal strains associated
with specific values of beta. The method of fracture energy for
determining the softening slope is explained in Lu and Panagiotou (2013)
and the same values, with a reference length of 600 mm = 23.6”, is
used.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>The wall is loaded with the gravity load of 75 kips before the cyclic
analysis. This is analyzed separately using 10 steps of load control.
Following that, the gravity loads are kept constant while the lateral
displacements are applied at the top node of the truss model, as show in
Figure 1. The lateral displacement is done by displacement control with
a displacement increment of 1e-4 inches per step, which is equivalent to
540 steps for each 0.1% drift.</p>

experimentally measured and computed response for Wall WP1105-8; (b)

points of first concrete diagonal softening and crushing.</a></p>
<p>Figure 3(a) shows the comparison of experimentally measured and
numerically computed global lateral force-displacement response. The
figure marks the points where the diagonal strain first exceeds 0.2% and
0.41% compression strain, corresponding to the instance of peak uniaxial
compression strength and 0 compression strength, respectively.</p>
<p>The experiment resulted in diagonal crushing of the concrete at a
drift ratio of 0.85%; the analytical model computed the crushing of the
diagonal concrete at 0.7% drift in Diagonal E1 [shown in Figure 1(b)].
Figure 3(b) shows the stress-strain history of Diagonal E1, showing the
compression strength reduction due to normal tension strain. Figure 2
shows the pseudo-time history of drift ratio, lateral force, and strain,
stress, and beta for Diagonal E1. [<a
