<p>This article discusses a three-dimensional effective stress site
response analysis of a slope using OpenSees. The considered site
consists of layered cohesionless soil underlain by bedrock. The slope
has a 2% grade perpendicular to the direction of shaking. The model
consists of a single column of 3D brick elements supported vertically at
the base. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in both horizontal
directions. A Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (1969) dashpot is utilized to account
for the finite rigidity of an underlying elastic medium, and the loading
is applied in a manner consistent with that proposed by Joyner and Chen
(1975).</p>
<p>Provided with this article are several files. Files which are
required for the analysis are indicated. The files include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The example input file, <a href="freeField3D.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeField3D.tcl</a> (<strong>required for
analysis</strong>)</li>
<li>The velocity time history of the selected earthquake record,
yerbaNSvelocity.out (<strong>required for analysis</strong>)</li>
<li>A GiD post-process mesh file, freeField3D.flavia.msh (generated
automatically by running <a href="freeField3D.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeField3D.tcl</a>)</li>
<li>A Matlab script, flaviaWriter.m, which can be used to reformat the
recorded output from OpenSees into a file which can be read by GiD for
post-process visulization. Non-Matlab users may find the process
represented by this file useful in creating an alternative means for
accomplishing this reformatting.</li>
<li>The post-process results file, freeField3D.flavia.res, which is
generated through the use of the flaviaWriter.m script. This file,
combined with the file freeField3D.flavia.msh, allows the user to
visualize the results of the site response analysis using GiD.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the files mentioned above can be downloaded <a
href="Media:_SiteResponse3D.zip" title="wikilink"> here</a>.</p>
<p>To run this example, the user must download the input file, <a
href="freeField3D.tcl" title="wikilink">freeField3D.tcl</a>, and the
velocity time history file, yerbaNSvelocity.out, and place them in a
single directory. The additional files described above are not essential
to the analysis. They are provided to demonstrate how to use the GiD
tool to visualize results from this type of analysis.</p>

<p>The site response analysis discussed in this article is for a soil
profile consisting of a 10 m thick layer of loose sand (Dr = 40%) above
a 20 m thick layer of more dense sand (Dr = 75%). The profile is assumed
to be on an infinite slope with a 2% grade. The soil profile is the same
as that described in the <a
href="Effective_Stress_Site_Response_Analysis_of_a_Layered_Soil_Column"
title="wikilink"> 2D effective stress site response</a> example The
entire soil profile is underlain by an elastic half-space which
represents the finite rigidity of an underlying bedrock layer. The
groundwater table is located at a depth of 2 m. Earthquake excitation is
applied in the direction perpendicular to the slope.</p>
<h3 id="mesh_geometry">Mesh Geometry</h3>
<p>The input file <a href="freeField3D.tcl"
title="wikilink">freeField3D.tcl</a> is set-up in a manner such that the
user need only define the geometry of the soil layers and groundwater
table along with the number of elements (vertically) within each layer.
<strong>Note:</strong> if the ground water table is not located at the
surface, an additional soil layer must be included to differentiate the
dry or moist soil above the gwt from the saturated soil below the gwt.
The default values are for 0.5 m high elements. A single column of
8-node brick elements is created based off of the input information. The
vertical direction for this column is oriented with the global
y-direction, and the elements are sized equally in the global x- and
z-directions. The shaking is applied in the x-direction and the slope is
in the z-direction. A schematic representation of the model is shown in
Fig. 1.</p>
<h3 id="boundary_conditions">Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>The column of elements is supported vertically at the base. Periodic
boundary conditions are applied in the global x- and z-directions using
the <a href="equalDOF_command" title="wikilink">equalDOF command</a>.
Dashpots are applied at the base of the column in the global x- and
z-directions to simulate the underlying bedrock layer after Lysmer and
Kuhlemeyer (1969). The <a href="Viscous_Material" title="wikilink">
viscous uniaxial material</a> is used with <a href="zeroLength_Element"
title="wikilink">zeroLength elements</a> to define the dashpots.
Following the method of Joyner and Chen (1975), the dashpot coefficients
are defined as the product of the mass density and shear wave velocity
of the underlying bedrock. Above the groundwater table, the pore
pressure degrees-of-freedom are fixed to allow drainage. The pore
pressure degrees-of-freedom for all nodes below the groundwater table
are left free to indicate saturated undrained conditions.</p>
<h3 id="material_and_element_definitions">Material and Element
Definitions</h3>
<p>The soil constitutive behavior is modeled using the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1551.htm">PressureDependMultiYield02</a>
nDMaterial object. The default material parameters are based upon the
recommended table of parameters available on the <a
href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/manuals/usermanual/1551.htm">PressureDependMultiYield02</a>
page for the appropriate relative densities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The mass density input values for the material
objects should be total mass densities, i.e. above the groundwater
table, the mass density should reflect dry or moist conditions, and
below the groundwater table, the mass density should be the saturated
value.</p>
<p>Included with the material definitions for each soil layer are
additional parameters which are used by the elements. These include the
fluid bulk modulus, the voids ratio, the body forces, and the x-, y-,
and z-direction permeabilities. For effective stress analysis, the body
forces should be the components of gravity. Note the difference to total
stress analysis, where body forces are typically the components of the
material unit weight. The slope in this example is simulated as a static
shear stress generated by applying gravity with components in the the y-
and z-directions.</p>
<p>The <a href="SSPbrickUP_Element" title="wikilink"> SSPbrickUP
element</a> is used in this example. This element uses a u-p formulation
to consider the coupling between the solid and fluid phases of the soil
mixture. The <a href="SSPbrickUP_Element" title="wikilink"> SSPbrickUP
element</a> uses stabilized single-point integration for the solid
phase, and includes direction stabilization of the fluid phase in the
incompressible-impermeable limit via a stabilization parameter. This
element provides a computationally-efficient alternative to a
higher-order 3D u-p element such as the <a
href="Twenty_Eight_Node_Brick_u-p_Element" title="wikilink">
20_8_BrickUP Element</a>.</p>
<h3 id="loading_and_analysis">Loading and Analysis</h3>
<p>The analysis is split in to two phases, (1) an initial gravitational
phase and (2) a dynamic excitation phase. Separate recorders are
generated for each phase. The gravitational analysis phase serves the
purpose of developing the initial state of stress for the soil column,
including the static shear stress representing the infinite slope. In
the second phase of the analysis, an earthquake ground motion is applied
to the base of the soil column in a manner consistent with that proposed
by Joyner and Chen (1975). The motion is applied in the horizontal
direction perpendicular to the slope (x-direction).</p>
<p>During the gravitational analysis, the permeability in each direction
is set at 1.0 m/s to facilitate development of hydrostatic conditions.
After completion of this analysis phase, the permeabilities are updated
to their input values using the <a href="setParameter_command"
title="wikilink">setParameter command</a>.</p>

<p>Several sets of results are presents to demonstrate the types of
results which can be obtained from this type of analysis in OpenSees and
to allow the user to confirm proper download and implementation of the
example input files. Post-processing for the included plots was
accomplished using Matlab and <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a>. Refer to the following
section of this article for further information on post-processing with
GiD.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows the displacement at the top of the soil column (ground
surface) in the direction of shaking and the direction of the slope
along with the pore pressure ratio in the middle of the liquefiable
soil. The slope is initially stable, then loses stability and begins
move in the down-slope direction. As shown in Fig. 2, this loss of
stability is due to liquefaction in the saturated loose sand layer. If
the analysis is continued past the end of the applied ground motion, the
pore pressures will eventually dissipate and the slope will become
stable as the liquefied soil regains strength.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows how the down-slope displacement increases during the
application of the ground motion, and how this displacement correlates
with the reduced strength of the liquefiable soil as indicated by pore
pressure ratio. As shown, the down-slope displacement increases as the
pore pressure ratio approaches 1.0, then continues to increase after
this point. The displacements in this figure are magnified for clarity.

<h2 id="gid_visualization">GiD Visualization</h2>
<p>Several files have been included in this article for the purpose of
visualizing results in the pre- and post-processing tool <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/home">GiD</a>. The files related to this
purpose are available for download <a href="Media:_SiteResponse3D.zip"
title="wikilink"> here</a>. The files are:</p>
<ul>
<li>freeField3D.flavia.msh</li>
<li>freeField3D.flavia.res</li>
<li>flaviaWriter.m</li>
</ul>
<p>The file freeField3D.flavia.msh contains a list of the nodes and
elements used in the analysis in a format that GiD understands. This
file is automatically created by running the example <a
href="freeField3D.tcl" title="wikilink">freeField3D.tcl</a> in OpenSees.
The file freeField3D.flavia.res contains the data recorded during the
analysis by the OpenSees recorders in a format that GiD can read. The
Matlab script, flaviaWriter.m, converts the data recorded by OpenSees
into this format. Further information on the formats for the
*.flavia.msh and *.flavia.res files can be found in the GiD
customization manual available <a
href="http://gid.cimne.upc.es/support/manuals">here</a>.</p>
<p>To visualize the results in GiD, the user should take the following
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>download and install copy of GiD</li>
<li>save a blank project with the name freeField3D.gid</li>
<li>place the files freeField3D.flavia.msh and freeField3D.flavia.res
into the freeField3D.gid directory</li>
<li>with this project open, select the Postprocess option in the 'files'
menu</li>
</ol>
<p>The program will then load the post-processing data contained in
freeField3D.flavia.msh and freeField3D.flavia.res.</p>
